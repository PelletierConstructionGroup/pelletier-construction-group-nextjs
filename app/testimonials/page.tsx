              We hired Ryan with Pelletier Construction to do some home
              improvement to our house. We added a small deck to our backyard
              and also remodeled our two bathrooms, one of which is our master
              bath. We did it all, from tile work, replacing a shower with a
              tub, cabinets, flooring... His bid was very fair, his work ethic
              was superb, and the quality of work was excellent. He cares for
              customer service, and with each change or concern, he was very
              attentive and responsive, which was great and easy to work with. I
              definitely recommend working with him and his company, and will
              probably use them again for our future kitchen remodel.
