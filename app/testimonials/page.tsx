                We hired Ryan with Pelletier Construction to do some home
                improvement to our house. We added a small deck to our backyard
                and also remodeled our two bathrooms, one of which is our master
                bath. We did it all, from tile work, replacing a shower with a
                tub, cabinets, flooring... His bid was very fair, his work ethic
                was superb, and the quality of work was excellent. He cares for
                customer service, and with each change or concern, he was very
                attentive and responsive, which was great and easy to work with.
                I definitely recommend working with him and his company, and
                will probably use them again for our future kitchen remodel.
