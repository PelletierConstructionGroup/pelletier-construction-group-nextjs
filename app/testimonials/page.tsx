                We hired Ryan with Pelletier Construction to do some home
                improvement to our house. We added a small deck to our backyard
                and also remodeled our two bathrooms, one of which is our master
                bath. We did it all, from tile work, replacing a shower with a
                tub, cabinets, flooring... His bid was very fair, his work ethic
                was superb, and the quality of work was excellent. He cares for
                customer service, and with each change or concern, he was very
                attentive and responsive, which was great and easy to work with.
                I definitely recommend working with him and his company, and
                will probably use them again for our future kitchen remodel.

                We worked with the PCG team on two projects after moving into
                our new home in May 2021: 1) a renovation of our downstairs
                family room to remove some old style cabinets and 2) a remodel
                of our guest bathroom. Ryan led the team and did an excellent
                job. The team was able to get both jobs done on time, within
                budget, and everything looks fantastic. Of course, no project
                goes perfectly, but anytime an issue came up, Ryan was easy to
                reach and took care of it. We&#x27;ve since reached out to him
                for some small jobs (after we had a ceiling leak and to repair
                some of the wood floor that got damaged) and he was there for
                us.
